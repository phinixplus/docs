# PHINIX+ Documentation
This is the repository containing architectural documentation for the PHINIX+
system. Contained within are several separate documents addressing each part
of a complete system, including a few words from the author about relevant
topics as a preface.

The document source is written using [Typst](https://github.com/typst/typst).
An effort is being made to use the latest version of it if possible. No
system fonts are assumed. All required resources to compile the documentation
are included to ensure maximum visual similarity with the bundled PDFs.

The contents of this repository are licensed under the
[CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](LICENSE.txt) license. Note, however, that this
does not include implementations of the described architecture, but only
the documentation itself. Readers are free to implement their own system
independently and license it however they like.

= About the Author
This section talks about me, the author and individual who's behind the
majority of the work behind PHINIX+. This section will come off as the most
informal due to its nature but I believe knowing the person behind it all
might provide additional context. I will try to lay out my past as it relates
to the project and my aspirations for the future.

== On Hardware Engineering
I knew my passion was computer engineering since high school. Since then
I have been researching about the inner workings of computers and their
operating principles. Even though I am in the process of attending a
computer engineering course at a polytechnic university, most of my knowledge
had been acquired before university. In other words, as I am writing this,
I do not currently possess any formal experience or certification on the topic,
and instead am self-taught.

=== Sources of Info and Inspiration
Most of my knowledge about the topic has been acquired from online sources,
mostly Wikipedia and YouTube, and from direct assistance and guidance from
people I met online, mostly on Discord. I would like to use this opportunity
to point out a few of the exceptional people that have directly or indirectly
helped me progress in this field:
-	*Ben Eater*: The original homebrew computing youtuber. His series on
	building a CPU on breadboards was the catalyst that got me interested
	in the first place almost 10 years ago. He has since moved on to other
	interesting topics in the field.
-	*James Sharman*: His advanced homebrew computer series captured the
	imagination of many, myself included. His design explores more complex
	topics in the field, such as pipelining and bus timings, as well as
	portrays the immense software development effort that follows a
	completed build.
-	*Open Redstone Engineers*: It might seem silly at first, but a Minecraft
	community of all places, ORE, has been the single most important gateway
	to people whose contributions to my journey cannot be understated. I
	joined this community about the same time as Ben Eater was creating his
	breadboard computer series.
-	*Clamentos*: A member of ORE, he was the person that took time out of his
	days to explain to a stranger on the internet, me, the principles behind
	and operation of pipelining, cache memory and branch prediction better than
	any professor at my university could.
-	*LordDecapo*: A member of ORE, he recognized the potential in me and
	taught me how to program in SystemVerilog, thus allowing me to escape the
	virtual realm of Minecraft's simulated wiring system. Later, as per his
	suggestion, I bought the very DE0 Nano FPGA development board that will
	ultimately be used to host PHINIX+.

== On Typesetting
Typesetting is also an activity which I have had to teach myself. Even though
my university did provide a lesson on technical document writing, it was not
as useful as one would hope. Regardless, I was already trying to learn myself
before I even took that lesson. And as per my choice of the typesetting
program, I chose Typst simply because it was the easiest one for me to get
into while providing a wide range of features and an expansive, complete
syntax. I did look into LaTeX but I quickly got overwhelmed and decided
to not use it.

Since I am not confident in my writing abilities, I'd like to point out that
if you would like to suggest something regarding the documents, don't hesitate
to reach out on our #link(discord-link)[Discord server] or make a pull
request on the documentation's #link(github-docs-link)[GitHub repository].

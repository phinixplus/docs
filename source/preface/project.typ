= About the Project
*This chapter is under construction*

This documentation and the overall design and direction of the PHINIX+
project is my personal project which I have been working on during my
free time. Due to this, development naturally has been an ongoing effort,
with a time span measured in years. It is not surprising considering
the scale of the project and that this is, at least for now, a one man show.

== The Catalyst
I never got to experience early computing or the home computer revolution.
As a result, I made it my goal to come up with a completely independent
computational system that would mimic the experience of using systems of the
late 1980s to early 1990s, as per my previously mentioned fascination with
designs of the past.

== The Goal
PHINIX+ attempts to be a platform from which many of the concepts common in
the modern computing environment could be understood (such as Operating Systems)
through re-implementation, as well as a platform on which the retro community
could build upon. PHINIX+ thus tries to cater to many use cases and it should
be wholly up to the implementer which of those use cases is most important for
what they want out of the system.
